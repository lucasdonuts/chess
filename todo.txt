RIGHT NOW: Letter and number coordinates in display_board function

Add letter and number coordinates to display_board function

Implement en passant
  Implemented on board, but piece still doesn't recognize legality

Add king in check function
  Rules: The king and the corresponding rook haven't moved yet
         All spaces between the king and the rook must be empty.
         The king cannot be put in check.
         The squares that the king passes over must not be under attack.

Implement promotions

Implement get move functions DO THIS NEXT FOR ALL PIECES
  Possibly create check_square function to be used with case statement
    case check_square
    when capture
    when friendly
    when empty
  pawn DONE
  knight DONE
  queen DONE
  king
  rook DONE (Except for castling, most likely will be in king class)
  bishop DONE
  update all class move functions to check if move puts king_in_check

Decide if get_moves needs to be tested in board_spec or not

Probably don't need general piece superclass

Add function to check if piece has no moves (no_moves?)

Add menu functionality to input validation
  Help
  Quit
  Save

Refactor Piece classes
  Maybe combine up/down move and left/right move functions
    Rook DONE
    Queen

Refactor board class
  Refactor validation methods to include check_square function

Refactor board tests
  current_players_piece? doesn't need to create player instances or create a variable for piece DONE
  Redundant functions and tests?
    get_white_positions DONE
    get_black_positions DONE
    path_obstructed? DONE
  Properly place and remove new board instances

Refactor piece tests
  Make rook tests more closely resemble bishop with pieces created at 5, 3 and 2, 4
  Possibly pawn tests as well, but probably not needed
  See if it's possible to remove board dependencies with mocks and/or doubles
